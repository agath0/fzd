# fzd

#### It's just batch script that lists out all the files with the file name
#### that we provide and provides an easy way to change your directory to 
#### the location you prefer


## USAGE

```
$ fzd filename
```
#### This will now list the directories of all files having specified filename
#### along with numbering by its sides.
#### Then just enter the number of the directory you want to change into
#### and this will change your location to that directory
#### If you want to quit while the directories  are displayed just enter 0.

## NOTE
#### Can take so much time when done from root directories(C:,D:,etc...)
